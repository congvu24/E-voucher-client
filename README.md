# Introduction

Bootstrap and package your project with Angular 12 and Electron 13 (Typescript + SASS + Hot Reload) for creating Desktop applications.

Currently runs with:

- Angular v12.1.2
- Electron v13.1.7
- Electron Builder v22.11.9

## Getting Started

*Clone this repository locally:*

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/congvu24/E-voucher-client.git
```

*Install dependencies with npm (used by Electron renderer process):*

``` bash
npm install
```

*Account for testing:*
| Actor | Username | Password |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|Dealer|deader1@gmail.com| dealer1 |
|Supplier|supplier1@gmail.com| supplier1 |
|Goverment|goverment1@gmail.com| goverment1 |

There is an issue with `yarn` and `node_modules` when the application is built by the packager. Please use `npm` as dependencies manager.

## To build for development

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start

Voila! You can use your Angular + Electron app in a local development environment with hot reload!

The application code is managed by `app/main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Angular App (http://localhost:4200), and an Electron window. \
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import. \
You can disable "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `app/main.ts`.

## Project structure

|Folder|Description|
| ---- | ---- |
| app | Electron main process folder (NodeJS) |
| src | Electron renderer process folder (Web / Angular) |


## Browser mode

Maybe you only want to execute the application in the browser with hot reload? Just run `npm run ng:serve:web`.

## Included Commands

|Command|Description|
| ---- | ---- |
|`npm run ng:serve`| Execute the app in the browser |
|`npm run build`| Build the app. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run build:prod`| Build the app with Angular aot. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run electron:local`| Builds your application and start electron
|`npm run electron:build`| Builds your application and creates an app consumable based on your operating system |
